The accident On monday, I pushed code directly to main without creating a feature branch. This could have resulted in an unintentional deployment to staging. Fortunately, it was only an update to .gitignore! ;) The context In my current project, developers with the “maintainer” role can push directly to main. This is new to me, but ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>My Tddish Worfklow With Agents</title><link href="https://gredowski.com/blogging/2026/02/18/my-tddish-worfklow-with-agents.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Tddish Worfklow With Agents" /><published>2026-02-18T18:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2026-02-18T18:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://gredowski.com/blogging/2026/02/18/my-tddish-worfklow-with-agents.html</id> <content src="https://gredowski.com/blogging/2026/02/18/my-tddish-worfklow-with-agents.html" /> <author> <name>piotrgredowski</name> </author> <category term="Blogging" /> <summary> This post was a response to a post from Michał Warda on Linkedin:. I’ve moved toward a TDD-ish workflow with agents: plan the implementation, review that plan, implement all tests I see for the planned interface, let the agent cook (sometimes in a Ralph Wiggum loop) until the suite stays green. Tests are usually as much “end to end” as they can be. If agent needs to change the tests, ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Activating Python virtual environment in PowerShell</title><link href="https://gredowski.com/blogging/2024/03/28/activate-function-in-powershell.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Activating Python virtual environment in PowerShell" /><published>2024-03-28T07:26:08+01:00</published> <updated>2026-02-25T16:46:53+01:00</updated> <id>https://gredowski.com/blogging/2024/03/28/activate-function-in-powershell.html</id> <content src="https://gredowski.com/blogging/2024/03/28/activate-function-in-powershell.html" /> <author> <name>piotrgredowski</name> </author> <category term="Blogging" /> <summary> When I’m working on Windows in the repository where I build executables, I’m usually using two types of virtual environments for my Python development. One is called .venvdev and it’s located in the root of my project. It’s used for development purposes. Another is called .venv, it’s located in the same directory as .venvdev and it’s used for production purposes. Whenever I need to build for e... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Linting whole project in VSCode with flake8</title><link href="https://gredowski.com/blogging/2021/02/21/linting-whole-project-in-vscode.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Linting whole project in VSCode with flake8" /><published>2021-02-21T19:56:59+01:00</published> <updated>2026-02-25T16:46:53+01:00</updated> <id>https://gredowski.com/blogging/2021/02/21/linting-whole-project-in-vscode.html</id> <content src="https://gredowski.com/blogging/2021/02/21/linting-whole-project-in-vscode.html" /> <author> <name>piotrgredowski</name> </author> <category term="Blogging" /> <summary> Intro When your pipeline fails because your linter reported some problems in your code - you have to go to file on your computer, find problem and fix it. Or you can run your linter locally, click on file name - go to faulty line and fix it. You won’t have such problem if you have configured precommit hook which runs all your scripts for code analysis before commit is created.

Sonar analysis is part of our CI pipeline and it gives great tips on how to improve quality of our code - no doubts. But my goal was to not have to wait for analysis done and to go to SonarCloud website which will show me results of Sonar analysis.
