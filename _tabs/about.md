Fullstack developer familiar with **Python** and TypeScript (**Angular**) from Warsaw (PL).

Open to new technologies and frameworks. Enthusiast of good practices in software
development, process automation and the idea of open-source. I really, really love to automate things.

In spare time I play table tennis (not so often lately...), [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/pgredo) (very often),
play tycoon and strategy games (Civilization VI ðŸ’–),
travel and admire Art Nouveau paintings.

## Why I decided to write blog?

I just wanted to have a place in which I can write down how I solved some problems, how I achieved some goals etc.

And then - share it with somebody who'll maybe have the same problems or ideas.
