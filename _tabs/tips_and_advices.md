I want to share some tips, advices that have helped me in my daily life. Every of the below recommendations is something that I personally use and like. Some of them are truisms (sorry), some are products or services.
List will be updated over time, when I find something new or old that I really like and want to share.

## Get

- **Buy ebook reader**. I have Kindle Paperwhite 5th gen for don't know how many years. It's great for reading books without distractions.
- **Buy standing desk**. I work from home and it's really helpful for my posture and health.
- **Have a VPS for personal projects**. I use it for small applications, and for learning purposes. I use [Mikr.us](https://mikr.us/?r=piotrgredowski) - that's referral link. They have great prices for small VPS. Great for hobby projects.
- **Have a mini PC at home**. I have some very cheap mini PC from HP. It's always on and I use it to host for example Home Assistant. Takes few watts of power.
- **Use password manager**. I use Bitwarden.
- **Use 2FA for important accounts**. Like Google Authenticator.
- **Buy YouTube Premium**. Ads are annoying and premium gives you background playback on mobile. I prefer supporting content creators this way.
- **Buy 3D printer**. Real life changer for creative people. I bought Bambu Lab P1P first. And later Bambu Lab A1 Mini with AMS lite. I really recommend them for fast prototyping and printing spare parts for household.
- **Learn to 3D model**. I use Fusion 360 for that. Free for personal use. It's really helpful to create custom parts for 3D printing.
- **Buy wireless vertical vacuum cleaner**. Like Dreame T20. I had it. It has it's pros and cons. Right now have also budget Laresar V11. Cheap and good enough. It's really good to have one for quick cleanups. Especially when you have pets.
- **Get motorcycle license and a motorcycle**. It's fun and super practical in many situations. Especially to get from village to center of the city.
- **Use noise cancelling headphones**. I have AirPods Pro 2. They are great for focusing in noisy environments.
- **Buy yourself multifunction tool**. I have few Daicamping DL30 - one in the car, one at home, one at the bike. They are super useful in many situations.

## Do

- **Buy things from local stores when possible**. Better living conditions for people around you - better living conditions for you.
- **Be good to people, help them, at work, at the groceries, in everyday life.** Being kind is making me to feel better.
- **Eat healthy food, avoid sugar.** I try to avoid sugar as much as possible. I'm losing that battle sometimes, but overall I feel much better without sugar.
- **Read "The Courage To Be Disliked" by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga**. Just read it.
- **Don't underestimate your mental health**. Take care of it, as soon as you feel something is wrong, seek help.
- **Don't watch YouTube Shorts, TikToks, Instagram Reels, ~~Twitter~~ (that one I still do) and similar content**. They are devastating for your attention span and mental health. Really. Avoid them like plague.
- **Seek knowledge, don't consume content**. Be curious, read books, articles, watch documentaries. Don't be a passive consumer.
- **Allow yourself to rest**. Burnout is real and it's not worth it.
- [**You need to be bored**. Sometimes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orQKfIXMiA8)
- **Don't believe what you see in the internet**. AI generated content is everywhere. Photos, videos, text. [Be critical.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s_LnU8mH-Q)
- **Have your resume/CV up to date**. It's good to have it ready when opportunity knocks. Also it's good to see your achievements in one place.
